Project Title: NYC vehicle collision analysis


Team Members: 


Project Description/Outline: What causes the most car crashes. 


Research Questions to Answer: 
* What are the top ten most dangerous intersections? 
* What vehicle is most likely to be involved in crashes? 
* What is the most likely time of year/time of day to get into an accident? 


Datasets to Be Used:
Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes 
 https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes


Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 


“What are the top ten most dangerous intersections?”
1. Clean data to highlight relevant columns and filter out missing values
2. Filter columns by the most common on street name
3. Filter by most common cross street name associated with the street name
4. Display results


“What vehicle is most likely to be involved in crashes?”
1. Clean data for type of vehicle
2. Do a count analysis
3. Display results


“What is the most likely time of year/time of day to get into an accident?”
1.  Filter for time year/time of day, get rid of missing values
2. Create ranges, use the buckets or iloc/loc
3. Put into a dataframe
4. Filter it to show which range has the most crashes
