“What is the most likely time of day to get into an accident?”
 
During 2021 to September 2023, the most likely time of day to get into an accident in New York City was between 16:00-16:59 or 4-4:59pm.  The pie chart demonstrates the fluctuations in the amount of crashes throughout the 24 hour period in chronological order.  
Contrary to what I had first thought, the late hours in the evening had some of the lowest distributions of accidents.  My thinking was that since more people are out drinking, one is more likely to get into an accident.  Although it could still be true (dependent upon further research), that one is more likely to get into an accident *with a drunk driver* during those times, it was far more likely in NYC to get into an accident during the early to mid rush hour times, as well as the 2pm-2:59pm slot, which came in third, and is technically not rush hour.  
The least likely time to get into an accident was from 3:00-3:59am.  This leads me to believe that the more vehicles are on the road, the more likely it was for there to be an accident.  I think this because, traffic is heaviest during rush hour times, and the very least during the late hours of the night, which in my experience, there has been the fewest amount of cars on the road.  
We dug more and wanted to find out which days of the week had the most accidents.  This ended up being Fridays.  Most of the days were very similar however, about 299,000, and Friday was the most at 324,113.  Sunday had the least crashes at 243738.
If we were to expound further into crash data, it would be interesting to find the correlation coefficient between number of cars on the road and number of accidents.  Unfortunately, number of cars on the road was not in this dataset, but it may be possible to find for future research endeavors.
